Uses Computer Vision via Python OpenCV to read hand movement and control device audio levels.

Increase gap between Index finger and thumb to increase volume and decrease gap between index finger and thumb to decrease volume.

Staying at the same relative position for 2 seconds will stop tracking and leave the audio level where it is, and quickly double tapping your thumb and index together will resume 
tracking and volume control.
